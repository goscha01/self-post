# Deployment Changes Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to enable separate deployment of backend to Railway and frontend to Vercel.

## Files Modified

### 1. `railway.json`
- Changed builder from `DOCKERFILE` to `NIXPACKS`
- Updated start command to `cd backend && npm run start:prod`

### 2. `nixpacks.toml`
- Updated to specifically target backend directory
- Changed install command to `cd backend && npm ci`
- Changed build command to `cd backend && npm run build`
- Updated start command to `cd backend && npm run start:prod`

### 3. `frontend/vercel.json` (NEW)
- Created Vercel-specific configuration
- Set build and install commands
- Configured output directory to `.next`
- Added security headers and API routing

### 4. `frontend/next.config.js`
- Removed static export configuration (`output: 'export'`)
- Removed static export optimizations
- Enabled image optimization and compression for Vercel
- Set `trailingSlash: false` for better routing

### 5. `Dockerfile`
- Removed frontend build steps
- Removed frontend file copying
- Updated to only handle backend deployment
- Kept for local development purposes

### 6. `backend/src/main.ts`
- Removed static file serving (no longer needed)
- Updated CORS configuration to use environment variables
- Added proper CORS methods and headers
- Updated console logs to reflect backend-only deployment

### 7. `.railwayignore` (NEW)
- Excludes frontend files from Railway deployment
- Ensures only backend files are deployed to Railway

### 8. `frontend/.vercelignore` (NEW)
- Excludes backend files from Vercel deployment
- Ensures only frontend files are deployed to Vercel

### 9. `frontend/env.example` (UPDATED)
- Updated for Vercel deployment
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for Railway backend connection

### 10. `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (UPDATED)
- Comprehensive guide for both platforms
- Environment variable setup instructions
- Troubleshooting section
- CORS configuration details

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Separated Build Processes**: Backend and frontend now build independently
2. **Removed Static Export**: Frontend no longer exports static files for backend serving
3. **Updated CORS**: Backend now properly configures CORS for separate frontend domain
4. **Platform-Specific Configs**: Each platform has its own configuration files
5. **Ignore Files**: Ensure clean separation of deployment artifacts
6. **Environment Variables**: Proper setup for cross-platform communication

## Deployment Flow

### Railway (Backend)
1. Uses `nixpacks.toml` for build configuration
2. Builds only backend from `backend/` directory
3. Starts with `npm run start:prod`
4. Serves API endpoints only

### Vercel (Frontend)
1. Uses `vercel.json` for configuration
2. Builds frontend from `frontend/` directory
3. Deploys `.next` output directory
4. Serves frontend application

## Environment Variables Required

### Railway (Backend)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Your Vercel frontend domain
- Database and OAuth credentials
- JWT secrets

### Vercel (Frontend)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Your Railway backend URL

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale based on its own needs
2. **Platform Optimization**: Each platform uses its optimal deployment method
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Each service can be updated independently
5. **Better Performance**: Each platform can optimize for its specific use case
